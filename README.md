# CIS445 Project 1 (Group Project)

The objective of this project is to learn new programming languages, programming paradigms, technologies, etc. in all Computer Science related areas/domains. Also, you will learn how to work on the same project simultaneously in a distributed manner through Git/GitHub and how to handle the conflicts when you commit/push your changes to the remote repository.

You will **compare the newly learned materials with the existing ones** (what you have learned before), analyze their pros and cons, provide the use cases for both, and also produce/write some sample code. Also, **all the references used should be provided and clearly presented in the project**; i.e., you have to distinguish what you copy-and-paste from online resources to the one you actually produce/develop by yourselves.

An example of the project is the study of different data exchange formats/frameworks/mechanisms, such as 

1. JSON (what we have learned)

1. Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

1. [Apache Thrift software framework](https://thrift.apache.org/)

1. [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)

The following references provide some insights and detail analysis on them.

1. [Encoding and Evolution](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/ch04.html)

1. [Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol Buffers and Thrift](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/12/05/schema-evolution-in-avro-protocol-buffers-thrift.html)

And the comparison and the use case can be found here.

1. [Serializarion Frameworks](https://ganges.usc.edu/pgroupW/images/a/a9/Serializarion_Framework.pdf)

1. [How Uber Engineering Evaluated JSON Encoding and Compression Algorithms to Put the Squeeze on Trip Data](https://eng.uber.com/trip-data-squeeze/)

## Deliverables

1. In-class presentations (put in **presentation** folder)

1. A short report (5 - 10 pages) (put in **report** folder)

1. Your (each member's) responsibilities in the project (put also in **report** folder)

1. Sample code ((put in **code** folder)

## Rubric

1. Each member of the group should contribute to the project. The grades of individuals will be based on the activities and partitipation of the project.

## What to do

1. Form your group (up to 3 people in a group). Due: the end of the next class meeting

1. Find the topic of interest. Due: one week from the day of the project assignment. 

  **Note**: each team may propose multiple different topcs of interest, and the instructor will help identify one that is suitable for the project.

  **Note**: if in doubt, contact the instructor immediate. DO NOT WAIT! You only have about a month to work on this.
  
3. Distribute the work. Use the same example above, one person can learn Protocol Buffers, one can learn Thrift, and one can learn Avro. Use one to two weeks to grasp the fundamemtals (You are **NOT** expected to learn **EVERYTHING**.)

1. Compare the different related techniques/frameworks/etc.

## Other possible topics

1. Programming Paradigms - Object-oriented, functional, imperative, etc.
